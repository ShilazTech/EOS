Fortunately, a python API (https://github.com/eosnewyork/eospy) on github is now available which can be used to interact with EOS blockchain. And I used that with help from the developers of this API.

I successfully created a python script that collects all the necessary data ["index","roll_blocknumber","from_account","roll_predicted", "user_betvalue","user_currency", "user_seed", "Gameseed", "roll_result", "roll_reward", "roll_value"] from EOS blockchain and writes it into a csv file.

This script does exactly that.

Below is the link about my motivation to write this code :-
